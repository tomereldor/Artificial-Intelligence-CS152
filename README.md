# Artificial-Intelligence-CS152
Artificial Intelligence Course, Minerva.
In this course we learned about search strategies through the search space for solutions or the best paths, 
designing AI agents such as expert systems or game playing agents, 
and applying that through Python or Prolog (Logic language once built for AI). 

Check out the Final Project - it's somewhat of a tutorial explaining the various search strategies through one case study example of an expert system + AI agent built to ask the user for their preferences and interest, find the best jobs for them, and finding the best routes to get their for them.
