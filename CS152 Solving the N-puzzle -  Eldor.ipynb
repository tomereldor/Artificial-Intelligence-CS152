    "#### Data structure for representing each board state\n",
    "The data structure used to represent tiles state is a simple 1D array (python list). I'm working with this flat lists since it is the simplest datastracture which contains all the needed information yet lowest in complexity and computational resources (supposedly). It is also easier to use for some of the verifications and operations. So I'm flatteinning the given list.\n",

    "#### String(self) methods for printing\n",
    "Since, I read that a Str() impelmentation is needed, I interpreted it initially to represent the board visually in the most conveient way possible. Therefore this code first implements a visual nxn (square) representation of the board, to see most clearly the actual board state and inspect the validity of the moves and solutions.\n",
    "Later I read that the program should also print each step as sublists specifically. \n",
    "Therefore, when the *printit* flag is True, this program will print both the request single lines of nested sublist, followed by the visual representation fo the board along with the step number."
