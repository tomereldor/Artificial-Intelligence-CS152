    "Prolog's backend uses depth-first backwards chaining to perform unification. \n",
    "This means prolog starts from the goal and tries to find a way from the goal to the starting node. At each step, it tries to unify its temporary placeholder for step nelow, with the next available transition backwards from the goal to the starting point, until hitting the starting point.\n",

    "# Forward Chaining or Backwards Chaining\n",
    "Forward chaining will do the opposite: it will start looking from your starting point and build all the possiblities to proceed moving on, until (hopefully) reaching the goal in one of these paths.\n",

    "Below are a few more lessons about Forward Chaining taken from Russel and Norvig (2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So What is Forward Chaining?\n",
    "**Forward Chaining** is a type of *data-driven* reasoning. Meaning, reasoning in which the focus of attention starts with the known data. It can be used to keep building on top of the initial information we get (through the predefined \"knowledge base\", which you may think of as database for now, or through new inputs), derive conclusions from each piece of piece information, often without a specific query in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why Forward Chaining is not the best for this purpose of *searching for a particular goal*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### We can make improvements to forward chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward-chaining algorithm shown before is designed for ease of understanding rather than for efficiency of operation. \n",
    "There are three possible sources of **inefficiency**. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the “inner loop” of the algorithm involves finding a**ll possible unifiers** such that the premise of a rule unifies with a suitable set of facts in the knowledge base. This is often called **PATTERN MATCHING** and can be very expensive. \n",
    "2.  the algorithm **rechecks every rule on every iteration **to see whether its premises are satisfied, even if very few additions are made to the knowledge base on each iteration. \n",
    "3.  the algorithm might** generate many facts that are irrelevant** to the goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are then many variations to the forward chaining algorithm, for example: Incremental forward chaining, where it checks only for newly inferred facts at each stage; or RETE algorithm which preprocesses the set of rules in the knowledge base to construct a sort of dataflow network in which each node is a literal from a rule premise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another improvement is to use Backwards Chaining in the face of Goal-Driven questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms work backward from the goal, chaining through rules to find known facts that support the proof.\n",
    "Backward chaining implemented here is a **depth-first search algorithm**. Both Backward and Forward Chaining could be either depth-first, breadth-first, or some hybrid - depending on the implementation. Being Depth-First means that its space requirements are **linear in the size of the proof**.\n",
    "It natively does so using backwards chaining for resolution.\n",
    "This makes a lot of sense versus forward chaining, sense the queries we present it are **goal-driven**. Meaning, they do have a specific goal in mind. Usually, it is much more efficient if so to use the goal-driven backwards chaining. For much of the same reasons, prolog adpoted depth-first backwards chaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### However, Prolog's use of depth-first backward chaining is still not perfect.\n",
    "This algoithm is not perfect.\n",
    "First, it might not be the most efficient in cases where the search trees are build like a pyramid shape: Consider a case where there is one goal, many many possible starting points deeply nested, and we look for a path from the start to the goal by backtracking from the goal, going through many branches excessively. In such cases, if we would start from the starting leaf node and forward chain up to the goal, we are almost sure to find it in minimal time. This is a general case that is less suitable for Backwards Chaining, but not really Prolog's fault. \n",
    "**However, a future suggestion for development, could be to internally represent the fact tree, and ACCORDING to the specific tree given, and the speciifc query given, choose the chaining algorithm used for resolution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, there is a mismatch between depth-first search and search trees that include *repeated states* and *infinite paths*. \n",
    "If the user generates a wrong recursion such as a recursive self-calling function without resolution (or \"left-recursion\"), prolog will fail. That's even if the necessary sentences appear right after. Therefore, Prolog is incomplete as a theorem prover.\n",
    "Depth-first backward chaining also has problems with redundant computations.\n",

    "For that, I'll use a variant of prolog called \"Problog\". It is as intuitive and simple, but built for probabilistic calculations.\n",

    "#### Solution #2:\n",
    "##  A Built-in Depth-First Graph Search for the Shortest Path\n",
    "The above solution was a no-brainer, it simply \"brute-forced\" all solutions then picked the best one. It is more akin to a breadth-first search, but rather than inspecting the entire first layer and then proceeding to the best next step, it inspects ALL THE POSSIBLE PATHS first, then chooses. (So not really like a breadth first, but if the \"first step\" was calculating the entire path down each road...). \n",
    "It is not likely to get the best performance in large datasets, although it is certainly complete and sound (it will always find the best solution if solutions exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "So to solve this problem in a more native way, I'll make a WEIGHTED GRAPH for us to perform a WEIGHTED GRAPH SEARCH, where the weights correspond to the probabilities - but in their inverse, since the algorithms want to MINIMIZE the cost. This is a Depth-First Search, looking down at each branch until hitting the solution or backtracking to the latest intersection to inspect the other direction it missed most recently. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic search algorithm that could be improved too, but for the size of our KB and purpose that would be an unnecessary overkill. \n",
    "If you are interested, look up some improvmenet for Depth First algorithms such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depth-limited search, where the search algorithm is limited to a depth level (\"e.g., only go down 20 levels; i don't want to have more than 20 job transitions to reach my goal anyway). This is important to stop Depth First search from looping between sub-loops of mutually connected nodes infinitely, if there are any. There aren't any in our KB. But still this is not the ideal solution.\n",
    "2. Iterative Deepening depth-first search -  this algorithm finds the best depth limit. It does this by gradually increasing the limit—first, from 0, then 1, then 2, and so on—until a goal is found. At each stage it will check if it could reach the solution at this depth. This will occur when the depth limit reaches d, the depth of the shallowest goal node. Meaning, *it will only find the Shallowest Solution*. In our later implementation of finding the minimal cost path in a weighted graphs, that could be misleading, since the weights of (A,B,C) could be lower in total than the jump from A to C. We will apply it to have the \"safest\" (risk free) job routes; so moving from a programmer to a CTO to a CEO is \"safer\" than the leap straight to CEO.\n",
    "3. Bidirectional Search - this would be running two simultaneous searches—one forward from the initial state and the other backward from the goal—hoping that the two searches meet in the middle. Kind of like running the forward chaining and backward chaining until they meet, but using a particular kind of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that in this tutorial and applications our goal is to implement **simple and (reltively) understandable solutions** rather than the most sophisticated algorithms, since they are (a) not needed otherwise for this purpose and (B) the most relevant for the #audience.\n"
